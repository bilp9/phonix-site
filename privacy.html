  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 2025</p>

  <p>At Pierre Consulting Group LLC, we value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Phonix (“Software”) handles your data.</p>

  <h2>1. Local-Only Processing</h2>
  <p>All audio files and transcripts you process with Phonix remain on your device. We do not upload, transmit, or store your data on external servers.</p>

  <h2>2. Personal Information</h2>
  <p>The Software does not collect or transmit personally identifiable information. Your use of the app is entirely local unless you explicitly choose to connect to third-party services in the future.</p>

  <h2>3. Licensing and Activation</h2>
  <p>If license activation is required, the Software may validate your license key by communicating with our secure servers. No audio or personal content is transmitted.</p>

  <h2>4. Website Analytics</h2>
  <p>Our website (<a href="https://www.phonixplayer.com">www.phonixplayer.com</a>) may use analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) to collect anonymous usage statistics, such as page visits and traffic sources. This information does not include audio or transcription data.</p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard measures to protect any data exchanged for licensing or support purposes. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.</p>
